# Sideface — performance profile viewer

Sideface is a web app viewer for performance profile files from XHProf/uprofiler.

It is forked out of uprofiler code base (in turn forked from XHProf).

At one point the soul pain of tinkering on procedural code base circa 2009 became just too much.

Stability: **ridiculously not**.

## Installation

Is not advised.

 - [x] removal of global vars
